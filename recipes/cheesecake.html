    <h1><p>Awesome Cheesecake Recipe</p></h1>
    <img src="cheesecake.jpeg">
    <p><h2>List of Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><h3>Crust</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>128g of graham cracker crumbs, 9i to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>28g confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>74g tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Filling</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>425g cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>152g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li><b>To make the crust:</b> Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
        <li><b>To make the filling:</b> Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth.<br/> To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching.<br/> Pour the filling into the crust.</li>
        <li><b>To bake the cheesecake:</b> Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil.<br/> Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.</li>
        <li>Storage information: Store any leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage</li>          
        
    </ol>
